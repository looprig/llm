// Package aci implements a client for the Dstack private-ai-gateway "aci/1"
// confidential-inference protocol. This file defines the attestation failure
// reasons and the typed errors the package returns.
//
// Every attestation-chain failure is reported as the provider-neutral,
// fail-closed *llm.AttestationError (defined in pkg/llm); for those this package
// only supplies the reason strings and thin constructors. The one exported error
// type it does introduce is UnpinnedPolicyError, which is deliberately NOT an
// *llm.AttestationError: it is a pre-attestation configuration refusal (the
// supplied Policy pins nothing) raised before any chain runs, not an attestation
// result.
