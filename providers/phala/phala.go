// Package phala is the Phala confidential-inference provider: it owns the gateway
// base-URL default and a typed constructor (New) that wires the reusable,
// provider-agnostic aci attestation protocol into an attested inference.Client. aci
// enforces whatever acceptance Policy it is handed; this package ships no pinned
// trust anchors — the caller supplies the acceptance Policy with their own,
// externally verified pins (app-id, build provenance, KMS root). aci never imports
// this package (that would cycle); the dependency is one-way, phala → aci.

// gateway origin (e.g. https://inference.phala.com); an empty baseURL self-defaults
// to the canonical Phala host (defaultBaseURL). key is the bearer credential and is
// REQUIRED — the
// typed auth.APIKey parameter encodes that at compile time, and New fails closed on
// an empty string with a typed *llm.AuthRequiredError before any network call
// (checked BEFORE the base-URL default, so a missing key always wins). It then
// forwards to aci.New, which fails closed with *UnpinnedPolicyError on a policy that
// pins no acceptance set and did not opt out via aci.UnpinnedPolicy(). On success it
// returns the inference.Client aci implements.
